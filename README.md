# RibbonsColorRecursive
Punched out colored ribbons problem recursive solution

(Not an exhaustive solution because if generate larger model then Out of Memory will happen, the class instantiation is very costly operation, it should consider to create another model which consume less memory and no need a lot of class instantiation, the recursion also costly because when call recursively itself then push the return address into the stack, and it consume more memory.)
