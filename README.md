# RibbonsColorRecursive
Punched out colored ribbons problem recursive solution
5 ribbons with 1 billion holes.

(Not an exhaustive solution because it is not a fast solution 1 billion randomly generated hole positions on five ribbons, but we can improve that with some assync operations. Now I using bitwise operation each bit is represent a hole position, in this case the memory consumprion is lower than if represent a hole in one byte.)
